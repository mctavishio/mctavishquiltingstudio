In this one-hour course Karen McTavish teaches her technique for quilting free-motion Victorian feathers. The technique eliminates the need to pre-mark each feather. Karen also reviews a collection of over twenty diverse and stunning quilt examples that incorporate free-motion feathers.

Freehand feathers are beautiful and versatile. They can work in any part of a quilt, and on traditional, modern, pieced, trapuntoed, and appliquéd quilts. Feathers also combine with other quilting patterns with stunning results.

The technique is fun, and it saves you time. After you build your confidence you'll develop an intuitive sense of how to work with a quilt as you make in-the-moment decisions about where to apply feathers.

"My hope," says Karen, "is that this course expands your vision of what you can do, giving you the skills and confidence to creatively incorporate feathers into your own work." 

___________________

what you learn
___________________

  * You start by drawing on paper, learning to add feathers to triangles and squares. This method prepares you to add feathers to progressively more complex patterns.

  * Next you practice with white fabric samples, building your confidence and practicing the tricks that eliminate the need to pre-mark the feathers.

  * You see demonstrations on real quilts, with both longarm and domestic machines.

  * Karen McTavish shows and discusses twenty-one examples of quilts that incorporate feathering.

If you're a beginner, you'll learn how to get started efficiently with a beautiful and useful technique. If you're an advanced quilter this course will grow your confidence and introduce you to new possibilities.
