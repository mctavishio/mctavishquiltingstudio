		<!-- <h2>My story</h2>

			<p>
			The story of how I came to quilting is not traditional in any way. </p>
			<p> I was single mom in my 30s when I heard about machine quilting. I worked at an office job. I struggled juggling work and child
			care. I had experience painting murals and I was good at continuous line drawing, but I knew little
			about sewing and hadn't quilted or used a longarm quilting machine.
			</p>
			<p>
			I decided, though, to take the plunge and see whether I could support myself as a longarm quilter. I
			made plans to purchase a longarm machine and I applied to move into a small studio in an artist
			cooperative in Duluth, Minnesota. </p>
			<p> When I heard I was accepted into the artist cooperative I swallowed my fear, 
			called a moving van, and set off to begin my new life as a self-employed
			longarm quilter.
			</p>

			<h3>Beginnings</h3>
			<p>
			My longarm machine arrived one week after I moved into the cooperative. At that time there wasn‚Äôt much
			in terms of instructional quilting manuals, and I received only
			general instructions about the operation of the machine.
			</p>
			<p>
			As a non-quilter, though, I couldn't absorb the
			information I was given. I was overwhelmed. I believe I was instructed
			how to quilt a pantograph using a laser light, but I retained virtually
			nothing from the instruction I received.
			</p>

			<p> Accordingly, when I
			received my first quilt top from the local quilt shop I had no idea how to
			quilt it. I went to the library and picked up as many quilting books as I could hold in my arms,
			carrying them home to study.</p>
			<p>
			Most of my library books were written by hand quilters from the 1930s. I
			thought I should replicate what a hand quilter would do and started to quilt like them.
			What I didn‚Äôt know is that most machine quilters were still using pantographs. They weren‚Äôt doing
			traditional quilting yet.
			</p>
			<p>
			It was my lack of familiarity with machine quilting that inadvertently set me
			in the direction of custom heirloom-style quilting. I'm incredibly grateful to the women of my quilting community who
			trusted me with their quilts during that time.
			</p>

			<h3>The origins of McTavishing</h3>
			<p>
			I learned some common machine quilting background fillers, such as stippling and meandering, but
			after a few years I became bored with these patterns. I was playing around with pencil and paper
			trying to figure out a different quilting background filler to use that would be both unique and
			achievable. I drew some continuous line ideas that ended up looking like cartoon hair&mdash;very
			similar to the style of Alphonse Mucha. Mucha‚Äôs work can be found in Dover Books and in
			many poster art works of the Art Nouveau style. This is where my main inspiration came from and
			where I learned to be creatively free with shading and sketching.
			</p>
			<p>I started to use this style of "free-flowing meandering movement of long lines and shapes" in my
			customer quilts. I found that using this style of background filler looked really good in
			conjunction with contemporary appliqu√©. Not thinking much of the filler, other than a feeling of
			satisfaction when I handed over the completed quilt to the customer, I continued to use it when I
			thought it would look its best in my customers‚Äô quilts.
			</p>
			<p> Several of my customers were showing their
			quilts in local and national quilt shows. This is when I discovered how much the judges appreciated
			this new style of quilting. My customers‚Äô quilts were winning awards. A comment on a quilting
			critique read, "Machine quilter appears to be having way too much fun quilting this quilt." I
			thought this was pretty funny but it was totally true; I did have a good time quilting in this
			style.
			</p>
			<p>I was active on an email chat group for longarm quilters and someone had seen my "free-flowing
			meandering movement of long lines and shapes" (which is what I had been calling it) and the quilters
			all started to discuss what that style should be called.
			</p>
			<p>The term "McTavishing" was suggested by a
			quilter on the internet chat group. I was flattered but also pretty embarrassed. The name stuck, and
			I began to receive email from all over the country asking how to do this "McTavishing."
			</p>
			<h3>McTavishing is my fingerprint</h3>
			<p> McTavishing is my fingerprint, my style of background filler. And it became the story of how I
			grew into my quilting career.

			</p> -->

			<!-- LONGER VERSION -->

			<!-- <p>
				My story is not traditional in any way. I wish I could be the quilter who can say she was
				born with
				a needle in her hand and has been quilting since the age of two&mdash;but I prefer to tell you the
				truth.
				</p>

				<p> I was single mom in my 30s the day my mother called to say she was thinking of
				investing in a longarm quilting machine. My mother thought
				it was an excellent idea for us to have a mother/daughter business. I was working in a corporate
				office, but not embracing the office lifestyle. I had secretly wished
				to be self-employed but fear held me back and I brushed those thoughts from my head.</p>
				<p> When my mother called she told me everything I wanted to hear. After investigating quilting machine
				companies around the country she reasoned that I could quilt up to eight quilt tops a day. She explained
				I could work in my home as a quilter. She said that the majority of women who buy these machines are
				single mothers. (This isn‚Äôt quite the case, but I thought it sounded good at the time!)</p>
				<p> My mother purchased the machine for our business, and I made plans to move into an artist
				cooperative in Duluth, Minnesota. The cooperative is organized around supporting artists who make their
				living doing art.

				</p>
				<p>When moving day came I panicked. I was so full of fear that I decided to
				cancel the whole idea. I tried to call my parents, but they were not home. I called my friends and
				received no answer. I called my sister-in-law and thankfully she picked up the phone. I told her I
				was about to freak out and that this was a huge deal, and I really wasn‚Äôt a quilter and I didn‚Äôt
				even know what this quilting machine looked like, and how could I ever find a customer to do a quilt
				for, and on and on and on‚Ä¶‚Ä¶She asked me what the bottom line was, and I said, "If I am
				self-employed, I am going to be poor." She promptly told me, "Karen, lots of people are poor. Get
				over it."</p>
				<p>So I swallowed hard and got in my moving van with no idea why I decided to be a full-time
				longarm machine quilter except that I couldn‚Äôt stand working in an office environment.</p>
				<h3>Beginnings</h3>
				<p>One week
				after I moved into my studio, my mother‚Äôs machine arrived. At that time there wasn‚Äôt much in terms of
				instructional quilting manuals, and I received only
				general instructions about the operation of the machine. </p>
				<p>As a non-quilter, I was
				most concerned with how to place the needle in the needle bar correctly. My head was swimming
				with how to operate the machine, not to mention how to load a quilt. I believe I was instructed
				about how to
				quilt a pantograph using a laser light, but my brain just couldn‚Äôt hold that much information and I
				completely lost most of the knowledge working from the back of the machine. I knew I was most
				comfortable working from the front of the machine, which is where I work to this day.</p>
				<p>I received my first official quilt top from the local quilt shop in my area and had no idea how to
				quilt it. So, I went to the library and picked up as many quilting books as I could hold in my arms
				and took them home. </p>
				<p> Most of my library books were written by hand quilters from the 1930s. I
				basically thought I should replicate what a hand quilter would do and started to quilt like them.
				What I didn‚Äôt know is that most machine quilters were still using pantographs. They weren‚Äôt doing
				traditional quilting yet. From the start of my longarm quilting career I focused on custom heirloom
				style quilting.</p>
				<h3>The origins of McTavishing</h3>
				<p>I learned some common machine quilting background fillers, such as stippling and meandering, but
				after a few years I became bored with these patterns. I was playing around with pencil and paper
				trying to figure out a different quilting background filler to use that would be both unique and
				achievable. I drew some continuous line ideas that ended up looking like cartoon hair&mdash;very
				similar to the style of Alphonse Mucha. Mucha‚Äôs work can be found in Dover Books and in
				many poster art works of the Art Nouveau style. This is where my main inspiration came from and
				where I learned to be creatively free with shading and sketching.</p>
				<p>I started to use this style of "free-flowing meandering movement of long lines and shapes" in my
				customer quilts. I found that using this style of background filler looked really good in
				conjunction with contemporary appliqu√©. Not thinking much of the filler, other than a feeling of
				satisfaction when I handed over the completed quilt to the customer, I continued to use it when I
				thought it would look its best in my customers‚Äô quilts. </p>
				<p> Several of my customers were showing their
				quilts in local and national quilt shows. This is when I discovered how much the judges appreciated
				this new style of quilting. My customers‚Äô quilts were winning awards. A comment on a quilting
				critique read, "Machine quilter appears to be having way too much fun quilting this quilt." I
				thought this was pretty funny but it was totally true; I did have a good time quilting in this
				style.</p>
				<p>I was active on an email chat group for longarm quilters and someone had seen my "free-flowing
				meandering movement of long lines and shapes" (which is what I had been calling it) and the quilters
				all started to discuss what that style should be called. </p>
				<p>The term "McTavishing" was suggested by a
				quilter on the internet chat group. I was flattered but also pretty embarrassed. The name stuck, and
				I began to receive email from all over the country asking how to do this "McTavishing." </p>
				<h3>McTavishing is my fingerprint</h3>
				<p> McTavishing is my fingerprint, my style of background filler. And it is the story of how I
				launched my quilting career. -->
