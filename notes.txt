Designer: Kaffe Fassett 
More: Kaffe Fassett is a leading textiles designer and practitioner of contemporary crafts. He has a loyal following of patchworkers, knitters and embroiderers all over the world. A Californian by birth, he moved to the UK in 1964 where through a series of collaborations, he built his name and reputation. He began by creating knitwear designs for Bill Gibb and Missoni. He became a leading light in the knitwear revival of the 80s.

Further explorations led him to needlepoint, mosaics, rug-making, tapestries, fabric design, theatre design and quilting. Kaffe Fassett’s first needlepoint design was commissioned by Pamela Lady Harlech for Lord Harlech. His work has been collected by Barbra Streisand, the late Lauren Bacall, Ali McGraw, Shirley Maclaine and H.R.H. Princess Michael of Kent.

In 1988 he became the first living textile artist to have a one man show at the V&A Museum. He has exhibited in countries including Denmark, Sweden, Australia, Canada, the USA and Iceland. His autobiography was released in 2012 (Kaffe Fassett: Dreaming in Colour) followed by a retrospective of his work at the Fashion & Textiles Museum, London in 2013.

Kaffe has written many books on colour and design in craftwork. Known and loved by quiltmakers across the world, his masterclasses are attended full to brimming. He inspires people to work with colour in an instinctive way.

Designer: Tula Pink 
More: Tula Pink is an illustrator, a fabric designer, a quilter, an author, a maker and a generally good person who enjoys talking about herself.

Tula graduated from Otis College of Art and Design in Los Angeles, CA. It was fun but she was tired of being broke so she decided to get a job. Tula worked briefly as an Exhibit designer for Museums in Southern California, where she grew up, and when that became too quiet she relocated to the music industry. After about 5 years of that her ears began to bleed so she left her job and California and went in search of a new home. The plan was to move as far east as she could get without renting a boat and work her way back west until she found a place she liked. Tula got about half way and then she ran out of gas money so she stayed put.

Tula now lives in a small mid-western town outside of Kansas City, MO in a house that used to be a barn and still sort of looks like one. Tula's main function in life is fabric design. She lives for it. Her signature designs have been adapted to fabrics, woven ribbons, paper products, needlepoint kits, embroidery patterns and sewing machines and can be found in independent fabric shops and retailers all over the world. Tula is most recognized in her industries for her dark sense of humor, a flair for hiding animals in the strangest of places (artistically, not literally) and her boldly unique use of color and pattern. Tula comes from the "more is more" school of design where there is never enough space and always room for that one last thing.

Today Tula Pink works closely with the good people at FreeSpirit Fabrics to develop multiple fabric collections every year, is an Ambassador for BERNINA sewing machines, develops collections for Aurifil Threads and Renaissance Ribbons and writes books for F+W Media about quilting and sewing. She works all day everyday and gets very cranky when she is asked to leave the studio or if Tula Pink is her real name.

Designer: Anna Maria Horner 
More: Anna Maria grew up in a house full of her dad's paintings and with a closet full of her mom's handiwork. Beds were warmed by the hand-loomed wool blankets sent by her grandmother from Greece. She and her siblings were warmed by the beautiful hand-knits sent from her grandmother in Indiana. As a kid in the 70's, she passed store-bought Barbie dresses and instead created her own from her mother's fabric scraps.

In 1995, after graduating with an Honors Fine Arts Degree in Drawing from the University of Tennessee, Anna Maria opened Handmaiden, a clothing and housewares boutique. Designing clothing served a lifelong interest but she kept her hands in many mediums on a daily basis. Anna Maria's paintings, both small and large scale, are the part of hundreds of private and commercial collections.

Somewhere around 2001, her fascination with taking an idea through all the necessary steps from her sketchbook to a store shelf sparked the momentum to create a brand. Anna Maria's fresh perspectives within traditional markets and her vision of being surrounded by the work of her own hands has led her to partnering with more than two dozen manufacturers to design homewares, gift items, textiles, authoring three sewing books, and publishing a continuing collection of sewing and needlework patterns. Her focus has intensified in the craft and creative industry where her heart has always been.

Anna Maria and her family make their home on a rambling two acres in Nashville, Tennessee. She works from a lofty, attic studio filled with fabric, thread, drawings, scribbled schemes and the remnants of intermittent playtime with children. She is the mother of seven who range in age from 5 to 26. Anna Maria is incredibly thankful to be able to seek out her artistic goals in the presence of her family and is inspired by the spontaneity and tempo of life.

Designer: William Reue 
More: 
William Reue is an architect, artist, and quilter whose creative pursuits explore the intersections between abstraction and the built environment. He maintains an architectural practice in New York City and is known for his thoughtfully-considered projects that marry creativity with pragmatism.

William’s interest in quilting and fabric design was sparked when he attended a free quilting workshop with his sister, Yvonne, at her local library in Victoria, Texas. He was intrigued by how simple materials and fabrication techniques were used to create compositions of rich geometric complexity and profound meaning. Color, pattern, rhythm, hierarchy, logic -- the language of quilts is the language of architecture. He was instantly hooked, and he bought his first sewing machine immediately upon returning to New York City. His architecture office overlooking Madison Square Park transformed at night into a quilting studio where friends and clients would often stop by to examine his latest design experiments.

These days, William is quite busy designing fabric for FreeSpirit. In his spare time, you will find him wandering the streets of New York City with a cup of coffee and sketchbook in hand.
