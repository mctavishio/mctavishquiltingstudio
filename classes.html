		<h2>Longarm certification class</h2>
		<p>
		This is for the true beginner. This class is for those who have little to no experience on a longarm quilting machine. We will cover all the basics of longarm machine quilting, from maintenance to loading a quilt to quilting a quilt. Walk away with some confidence as a longarm machine quilter as well.
		</p>
		<p>
		If you have taken this class, you are eligible to rent machines on a regular basis at McTavish Quilting Studio.
		</p>
		<p>
		Supply List: Any sized quilt top and backing (backing needs to be 4+ inches bigger than your quilt top). All threads are included in the beginner class. Batting available for purchase. Once you have taken this class you can rent a longarm forever in the studio.
		</p>

		In the beginner class you will be quilting your own quilt. You can design and quilt your own quilt during class. If you do not have a quilt top, we can use plain white fabric for your class if you prefer.
